Homework 5
==========

Problem 0
---------

A github repo and local R project was created, an Rmd file was produced, knitted, and committed to github.

Problem 1
---------

First loading all necessary packages

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## -- Attaching packages --- tidyverse 1.2.1 --

    ## v ggplot2 3.0.0     v purrr   0.2.5
    ## v tibble  1.4.2     v dplyr   0.7.6
    ## v tidyr   0.8.1     v stringr 1.3.1
    ## v readr   1.1.1     v forcats 0.3.0

    ## -- Conflicts ------ tidyverse_conflicts() --
    ## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

``` r
library(rvest)
```

    ## Loading required package: xml2

    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'rvest'

    ## The following object is masked from 'package:purrr':
    ## 
    ##     pluck

    ## The following object is masked from 'package:readr':
    ## 
    ##     guess_encoding

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(stringr)
```

Using list.files function to list all of the file names within the data folder and creating a dataframe for the file names. The map function and read\_csv function are used to map the contents of each csv file onto the file name dataframe.

``` r
data_folder = "./data"

file_names = list.files(data_folder)
```

``` r
reading_csv = function(x) {
  
  place_holder = read_csv(file.path(data_folder,x))
}
```

``` r
df_files = data_frame(file_names = file_names) %>% 
mutate(actual_files = map(file_names, reading_csv))
```

The values within the lists are unnested into the dataframe. The dataframe is then tidied by gathering the values into a "week" variable and assigning corresponding observation values.

``` r
df_files = unnest(df_files) %>% 
  gather(key = week, value = obs_value, week_1:week_8) %>% 
    separate(week, into = c("remove", "week"), sep = "_") %>% 
  rename(treatment_id = file_names) %>%
  mutate(treatment_id = str_replace(treatment_id, ".csv", "")) %>% separate(treatment_id, into = c("treatment", "subj_id"), sep = "_") %>% select(subj_id, treatment, week, obs_value, -starts_with("remove"))

df_files
```

    ## # A tibble: 160 x 4
    ##    subj_id treatment week  obs_value
    ##    <chr>   <chr>     <chr>     <dbl>
    ##  1 01      con       1          0.2 
    ##  2 02      con       1          1.13
    ##  3 03      con       1          1.77
    ##  4 04      con       1          1.04
    ##  5 05      con       1          0.47
    ##  6 06      con       1          2.37
    ##  7 07      con       1          0.03
    ##  8 08      con       1         -0.08
    ##  9 09      con       1          0.08
    ## 10 10      con       1          2.14
