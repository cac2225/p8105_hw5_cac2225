Homework 5
==========

Problem 0
---------

A github repo and local R project was created, an Rmd file was produced, knitted, and committed to github.

Problem 1
---------

First loading all necessary packages

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## -- Attaching packages --- tidyverse 1.2.1 --

    ## v ggplot2 3.0.0     v purrr   0.2.5
    ## v tibble  1.4.2     v dplyr   0.7.6
    ## v tidyr   0.8.1     v stringr 1.3.1
    ## v readr   1.1.1     v forcats 0.3.0

    ## -- Conflicts ------ tidyverse_conflicts() --
    ## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

``` r
library(rvest)
```

    ## Loading required package: xml2

    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'rvest'

    ## The following object is masked from 'package:purrr':
    ## 
    ##     pluck

    ## The following object is masked from 'package:readr':
    ## 
    ##     guess_encoding

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(stringr)
```

Using list.files function to list all of the file names within the data folder and creating a dataframe for the file names. The map function and read\_csv function are used to map the contents of each csv file onto the file name dataframe.

``` r
data_folder = "./data"

file_names = list.files(data_folder)
```

``` r
reading_csv = function(x) {
  
  place_holder = read_csv(file.path(data_folder,x))
}
```

``` r
df_files = data_frame(file_names = file_names) %>% 
mutate(actual_files = map(file_names, reading_csv))
```

The values within the lists are unnested into the dataframe. The dataframe is then tidied by gathering the values into a "week" variable and assigning corresponding observation values. Treatment and id variables are created. Week is mutated into a numeric variable. The treatment values are recoded into "control" and "experimental".

``` r
df_files = unnest(df_files) %>% 
  gather(key = week, value = obs_value, week_1:week_8) %>% 
    separate(week, into = c("remove", "week"), sep = "_") %>% 
  rename(treatment_id = file_names) %>%
  mutate(treatment_id = str_replace(treatment_id, ".csv", "")) %>% separate(treatment_id, into = c("treatment", "subj_id"), sep = "_") %>% select(subj_id, treatment, week, obs_value, -starts_with("remove")) %>% 
  mutate(week = as.numeric(week)) %>% 
  mutate(treatment = recode(treatment, "con" = "control", "exp" = "experimental"))

```

``` r
ggplot(df_files, aes(x = week, y = obs_value, color = subj_id)) + 
  facet_grid(.~treatment) + 
  geom_line() + 
  labs(
    title = "Observations over weeks 1-8 for each subject",
    y = "Observation Values"
  ) + 
  theme(legend.background = element_rect(size = .5))
```

![](p8105_hw5_cac2225_files/figure-markdown_github/spaghetti%20plot-1.png)

A spaghetti plot is created, graphing the changes in observation values for each individual subject. The graphs are separated by treatment type - control and experimental. There is a huge difference between the trends seen in the observation values for the control versus experimental groups. The control groups' values remain fairly low for all 8 weeks, hovering from approximately -1 to 3. Whereas amongst the experimental group there is a large, steady increase of the observational values over the 1-8 weeks, starting at around 0 to3.5 and increasing to around 3 to 6.

Problem 2
---------

The csv file is imported using the read\_csv function and the dataset is cleaned.

``` r
homicide = read_csv("./data2/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_integer(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Looking at the raw data, the number of observations and number of variables are 52179, 12. The variable names include uid, reported\_date, victim\_last, victim\_first, victim\_race, victim\_age, victim\_sex, city, state, lat, lon, disposition. The variables include identifiers describing the victim (id number, first and last name, sex and race), where and when the victim was found (using reported\_date, longitude and latitude coordinates, city) and whether the case was closed or still open.

A city\_state variable is created using the functions paste and mutate.

``` r
homicide = homicide %>% 
  mutate(city_state = paste(city,",",state))
```

``` r
total_num_homicides = homicide %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(total_num_hom = n())
```

``` r
unsolved_homicides = homicide %>% 
  filter(disposition == "Closed without arrest" | disposition == "Open/No arrest") %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(num_unsolved_hom = n())
```

The number of total homicides are added up per city\_state. The number of unsolved homicides based on disposition status is added up per city\_state. Comparing these two datsets, total\_num\_homicides and unsolved\_homicides, there are 51 and 50 observations respectively. The extra city\_state in the total\_num\_homicides set is Tusla, AL with one homicide. As a result it is removed since it is an outlier.

``` r
total_num_homicides$city_state[!(total_num_homicides$city_state %in% unsolved_homicides$city_state)]
```

    ## [1] "Tulsa , AL"

To determine the proportion of unsolved homicides over the total number homicides in Baltimore, MD, the datasets are merged by city\_state. The dataset is filtered by Baltimore, MD and the prop.test function is used to determine the proportion estimate and confidence intervals. The values are then put into a tibble.

``` r
df_combined = merge(total_num_homicides, unsolved_homicides, by.x = "city_state", by.y = "city_state")

df_combined_BMD = df_combined %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore , MD")

prop_BMD = prop.test(df_combined_BMD$num_unsolved_hom, df_combined_BMD$total_num_hom) %>% broom::tidy()

ouput_bmd = prop_BMD[c(1,5,6)]
```
